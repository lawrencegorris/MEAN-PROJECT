# MEAN (TESTREPO)
A repo/project to learn the MEAN stack. Really excited to try this out.

## The Mission
Creating a 'friend book' using the MEAN stack. Using mongoose queries to make a CRUD. Able to add, edit and delete friends and show their info.

## Must have features:
- [ ] Show friend data to client
- [x] Friend schema on server for sending/getting data to and from the server.
- [x] Friend model to contain friends data on server
- [ ] Styled and Responsive

## Updates:
Able to send and get data to database from server (hardcoded in server.js).
Can retrieve all-friends and single friend upon getting with unique ID.

## Commands
To run this project locally:

- In client folder, where the Angular app is located
`ng serve` for a dev server on `http://localhost:4200/`, (automatically reloads on change of any source file)

- In the server folder
`node server.js` or `nodemon server.js` (depending on if you have nodemon installed), to run the server
